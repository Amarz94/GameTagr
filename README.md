# GameTagr
The following application is a video game review page that allows the user to search for games that have reviews from real gamers. It uses a css library called primitive to provide a responsive layout.  Handlebars is the template engine used on all pages.  Sequelize is the database used to store all the data points provided by the user.  Code quality is covered using Travis CI to analyze our code for potential errors.  The application is deployed using Heroku and instructions on how to install the application locally are listed below.

## Usage
Our project is intended to be used by gamers of all ages to provide REAL reviews versus paid ones. We give the user the ability to search for reviews or create their own for any game, new or old. Many gaming sites are paid by gaming developers to give reviews which gives a false impression of a game.  If you search for a game and are pleased with the reviews, we provide the lowest price of the game on the marketplace.
